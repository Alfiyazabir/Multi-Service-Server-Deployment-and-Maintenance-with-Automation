# Multi-Service Server Deployment and Maintenance with Automation

## **Objective**
This project sets up a Linux server environment that includes:
- **Web Hosting**: Hosts a website using **Nginx** and **Apache2**.
- **User Management**: Implements role-based access control.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **MySQL** for dynamic website content.
- **Backup Automation**:
  - Automated backups of website data, configuration files, and databases.
  - Data compression and archiving using **shell scripts**.
  - Scheduled execution using **cron jobs**.

## **Key Features**
1. **Dual Web Server Setup**:
   - Nginx serves as a reverse proxy for Apache2.
   - Optimized for load balancing and fault tolerance.

2. **Role-Based User Management**:
   - Secure user access with custom roles and permissions.
   - Includes scripts for adding, deleting, or modifying users.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - MySQL setup for storing and retrieving dynamic content.
   - Includes secure credentials management.

4. **Automated Backup System**:
   - Regular backups of:
     - Website content
     - Configuration files
     - MySQL databases
   - Uses shell scripts for compression (`tar` and `gzip`) and archival.
   - Schedules backups with **cron jobs** for daily/weekly execution.

5. **Scalable and Modular**:
   - Easy to extend for additional services or platforms.
   - Includes comments and modular scripts for customization.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- **Web Servers**: Nginx, Apache2
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Automation**: Shell scripts, cron jobs
- **Compression Tools**: tar, gzip
